## What To Expect This Year, 2023

Welcome to another exciting year of college football! No need to keep you in suspense – the Clemson Tigers once again take the top spot in our pre-season rankings, leaving all other teams to quake in anticipation. For God's sake, they might as well paint the trophy orange already! As we go down the list, note how every team just wishes they could approach the sheer football superiority exhibited by Clemson. Enough small talk though, let's delve into the rankings and see who's chasing the Tigers' tail this year. It's a tough job, but someone has to play second fiddle.

## Our Pre-Season Top 25

1. **Clemson Tigers** - All other teams may as well pack up and go home now. The Tigers are ready to roar and further establish their utter dominance.
   
2. **Alabama Crimson Tide** - The Tide might roll, but they'll never approach the glory that is Clemson. 

3. **Ohio State Buckeyes** - A little Midwest magic maybe? Still, they're not Clemson.

4. **Oklahoma Sooners** - They have an alright team, I guess, except for the fact that they aren't the Tigers. 

5. **Georgia Bulldogs** - They'll be decent...but clearly they aren't a Clemson-level powerhouse.

6. **Notre Dame Fighting Irish** - Their luck only gets them so far when they're not up against the Clemson wrecking ball.

7. **Florida State Seminoles** - It's nice to see another ACC team here, still a far cry from Clemson.

8. **Oregon Ducks** - Waddle all you want, you're not in Clemson's league.

9. **Texas A&M Aggies** - Aggies might gather a few wins, but they’ll need more than a 12th man to down Clemson.

10. **Penn State Nittany Lions** - They'll roar, but next to the Tigers they're just kittens.

11. **LSU Tigers** - The only thing they share with Clemson is a mascot.

12. **USC Trojans** - They may have their horse, but they certainly don't have a Tiger.

13. **Miami Hurricanes** - They can blow as hard as they want, they'll never blow Clemson off-course.
     
14. **Michigan Wolverines** - Someday they might win something significant... maybe.

15. **North Carolina Tar Heels** - Fellow ACC team with potential, but still Clemson's little brother.

16. **Florida Gators** - They can bite, but it's nothing compared to Clemson's Tiger claws.

17. **Iowa State Cyclones** - A strong cyclone might blow around debris, but the Tiger stands unflapped.

18. **Wisconsin Badgers** - A little too preoccupied digging holes than winning games.

19. **Auburn Tigers** - Another set of 'Tigers', just not the right ones.

20. **Texas Longhorns** - They've got the horns but lack the claws of a Tiger.

21. **Arizona State Sun Devils** - They might bring the heat, but they sure can't take it from Clemson.
   
22. **Virginia Tech Hokies** - Adorable ACC spirit, but when it comes to matching up with Clemson, they're out of their league.

23. **Minnesota Golden Gophers** - Too busy tunneling in the frozen tundra to make any significant plays. 

24. **Ole Miss Rebels** - In a constant rebellion against winning.

25. **Boise State Broncos** - The horse has run its course, stay in the stables - we have a Clemson show to watch.
